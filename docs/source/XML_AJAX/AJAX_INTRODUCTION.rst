XML_AJAX
============
refers to a combination of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technologies. It's often used for making asynchronous web applications faster and more dynamic by allowing data to be retrieved from the server without having to reload the entire page.
