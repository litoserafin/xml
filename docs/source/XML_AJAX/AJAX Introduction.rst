AJAX Introduction
===================

What is AJAX?
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technology that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with a server behind the scenes.
This means you can update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page!

Key Concepts
🔄 Asynchronous: Webpage continues working while the request is being processed.

✍️ JavaScript: Used to send and receive data.

📦 XML/JSON: Formats often used to exchange data between client and server.

🌐 Server Communication: Typically happens through HTTP requests (GET or POST).

Why Use AJAX?
🌟 Create faster, more dynamic web applications.

🌍 Improve user experience by reducing full page reloads.

📡 Retrieve data from a server after the page has loaded.

🛠️ Submit forms, load content, or update data without refreshing the page.

Basic AJAX Workflow
User action triggers an event (e.g., button click).

JavaScript creates an XMLHttpRequest object.

Request is sent to the server asynchronously.

Server processes the request and sends back data.

JavaScript updates part of the web page using the response.
